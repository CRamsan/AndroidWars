AndroidWars
===========

This is reboot of my interest in bringing an Advance Wars style game to a new generation of devices. LibGDX is the game engine of choice for this, it is cross platform(Android, Web, Desktop, iOS) and uses java, which makes my life easier. 

On the first iteration the game will try to emulate Advanced Wars.

Once the game is stable and it can emulate most of the gameplay features of the original game I will start working on new features, gameplay and assets.

Building with Eclipse
=====================
To get the game up and running just follow the intructions on this page https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Eclipse
